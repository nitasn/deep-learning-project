\section{Introduction}

Deep-Learning in healthcare is a hot topic. As deep neural networks become increasingly involved in patient care, these networks must meet several requirements. Such requirements include high precision rate, transparency in their decision-making, and performing effectively even when valuable data is missing.

\subsection{The Dataset}
Kaggle's chest-xray-pneumonia dataset consists of 5,856 lungs X-Ray images of men and children. Each image is labeled either "healthy", "bacterial-infected" or "viral-infected". The data is split between train/set sets. One important issue to note is the classes are not balanced; each set contains a different ratio of images from the different classes.

\subsection{Our Tasks}
In this project, we demonstrate several different deep-learning techniques we learned during the course.

\textbf{Task 1.a. Binary Classification}: we train a CNN on healthy/sick labeled x-ray images of human lungs;

\textbf{Task 1.b. Multiclass classification}: we further improve the CNN to distinguish between bacterial/viral infection;

\textbf{Task 2. Embedding Space:} we apply KNN and t-SNE on embedding vectors we get from the aforementioned networks;

\textbf{Task 3. Anomaly Detection:} having trained on healthy lungs alone, we use auto-encoders to tell if lungs are sick;

\textbf{Task 4. Explainability}: we decipher the model's decision making, e.g. what's important to each layer and neuron.


\subsection{Related Works}
Previous research, such as \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05225.pdf}{CheXNet}, study by Rajpurkar et al. (2017), has shown the advantage of using CNN in medical diagnostics. The model proposed in the paper used CNN to output probability of pneumonia with a heat-map localizing the pneumonia areas from chest X-ray images.

\section{Task 1.a: Binary Classification}

\subsection{Solution}
\subsubsection{The Task}
In this task, we treat both bacterial and viral images as
\textit{sick}, and train a model to classify \textit{healthy}/\textit{sick} lungs x-ray.

\subsubsection{General approach}
We use several convolution layers, followed by a few dense layers. It is the field's classic and go-to way to classify images. Furthermore, the limited dataset size (approximately 5K images) posses a serious restriction on the complexity of the network, as overly powerful architectures risk significant over-fitting.

\subsubsection{Design}

Our network's architecture mimics the great: we took inspiration from the architecture of the VGG networks family. We tailored their layer sizes to our needs after thorough experimentation, maximizing accuracy, while battling over-fitting. The final network structure is portrayed in Figure~\ref{fig:model_1}.

\textbf{Platform:} we built the model as a Keras Sequential on a kaggle notebook. It ran for $\sim$30 minutes using a P100 GPU. 

\textbf{Loss:} we used binary-crossentropy, as it's classic in the context of binary classification, and it worked for us. 

\textbf{Optimizer:} we used Adam with initial learning rate of 1e-4, but also installed a callback to further lower it on plateau.

\textbf{The Splits}: The train and the 16-images given val were concatenated and re-split into 80\% train and 20\% validation.

\textbf{Limited dataset size:} as said, we only had a few thousand images to train on.
To combat it, we used many augmentation methods to compensate for the lack of data. We also limited the number of epochs.

\textbf{Class imbalance:} the sets had different distributions of labels.
We removed excess data from the train/val sets until each class appeared 50\%; we found that to be more effective than assigning weights. The test-set, having a 62.5\% class imbalance, was left as is.
