\section{Introduction}

Deep-Learning in healthcare is a hot topic. As deep neural networks become increasingly involved in patient care, these networks must meet several requirements. Such requirements include high precision rate, transparency in their decision-making, and performing effectively even when valuable data is missing.

\subsection{The Dataset}
Kaggle's chest-xray-pneumonia dataset consists of 5,856 lungs X-Ray images of men and children. Each image is labeled either "healthy", "bacterial-infected" or "viral-infected". The data is split between train/set sets. One important issue to note is the classes are not balanced; each set contains a different ratio of images from the different classes.

\subsection{Our Tasks}
In this project, we demonstrate several different deep-learning techniques we learned during the course.

\textbf{Task 1.a. Binary Classification}: we train a CNN on healthy/sick labeled x-ray images of human lungs;

\textbf{Task 1.b. Multiclass classification}: we further improve the CNN to distinguish between bacterial/viral infection;

\textbf{Task 2. Embedding Space:} we apply KNN and t-SNE on embedding vectors we get from the aforementioned networks;

\textbf{Task 3. Anomaly Detection:} having trained on healthy lungs alone, we use auto-encoders to tell if lungs are sick;

\textbf{Task 4. Explainability}: we decipher the model's decision making, e.g. what's important to each layer and neuron.


\subsection{Related Works}
Previous research, such as \href{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05225.pdf}{CheXNet}, study by Rajpurkar et al. (2017), has shown the advantage of using CNN in medical diagnostics. The model proposed in the paper used CNN to output probability of pneumonia with a heat-map localizing the pneumonia areas from chest X-ray images.

\subsubsection{The Task}
In this task, we treat both bacterial and viral images as
\textit{sick}, and train a model to classify \textit{healthy}/\textit{sick} lungs x-ray.

\subsubsection{General approach}
We use several convolution layers, followed by a few dense layers. It is the field's classic and go-to way to classify images. Furthermore, the limited dataset size (approximately 5K images) posses a serious restriction on the complexity of the network, as overly powerful architectures risk significant over-fitting.

\subsubsection{Design}
Our network's architecture mimics the great: we took inspiration from the VGG networks' architecture (but we didn't transfer weights; more on that later).

The final version of the notebook takes $\sim$30 minutes to run on Kaggle.
